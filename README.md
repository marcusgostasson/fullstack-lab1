## Example of a Recipe Document (to insert manually in MongoDB)

Copy and paste this command directly in MongoDB playground to add the recipe to your database:

```
use yourDatabaseName

db.dishes.insertOne({
  name: "Mormor's Apple Cake",
  ingredients: [
    "apples",
    "flour",
    "butter",
    "sugar",
    "cinnamon",
    "baking powder",
    "egg",
    "milk"
  ],
  preparationSteps: [
    "Peel and slice apples",
    "Mix dry ingredients together.",
    "Add egg, milk, and melted butter to form batter.",
    "Pour batter into baking dish and add apples on top.",
    "Bake until golden and cooked through."
  ],
  cookingTime: 45,
  origin: "Sweden (Family Recipe)",
